Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans: Reomte repository is required when you want to collaborate with several people. Now with a remote repo, we can 
send local work to central location. Others can also send thier work to same remote repo. In this way mutiple developers can 
work together.
